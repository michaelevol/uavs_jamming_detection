# UAVs Jamming Detection and Classification

## Launching of Jamming Attacks
In folder 'The Screeenshots of GNU Radio Blocks for Launching Jamming Attacks', the detailed parameters for launching jamming attacks via GNU Radio are provided.
## Feature-based Approach
This folder contains the dataset we used for training and testing. It also contains another dataset that sorts out data based on the jammer location and separation w.r.t the drone. Finally, it has the python codes for the six conventional maching learing classifiers.
## Spectrogram-based Approach
This folder contains the spectrograms dataset we used for training and testing. It also has the python codes for the four CNN deep learing classifiers.
